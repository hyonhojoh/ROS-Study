## ROS Build System

+ 각 소스코드들은 package에서 관리하여, 하나의 패키지들은 1개 이상의 소스 코드를 빌드하게 됨.
  + catkin은 ROS의 공식 build system (ROS2는 아님)

+ ROS의 파일 시스템
  
  1. ROS의 runtime process들을 관리 (node)
   
  2. 해당 node들의 dependency를 관리
  3. Dataset 등을 관리
  4. 알고리즘의 Configuration files들을 관리

+ 패키지의 관리
  + 커스텀 패키지들은 사용자의 workspace에서 만듦 (주로 catkin_ws로 생성)

  + __package 마다 CMakeLists.txt, package.xml이 있어야 함!!__


## WorkSpace 지정

~/.bashrc 파일을 수정하여 작업중인 workspace를 지정해줘야 함.
```
$ gedit ~/.bashrc
```

ROS noetic을 사용하기 위한 환경설정
```
$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

작업중인 workspace를 아래와 같이 등록해줘야 함.

(필자는 workspace로 ros_study_ws를 사용하고 있음)
```
$ source $HOME/ros_study_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## __CMakeLists.txt__
### Overall Structure and Ordering
1. __Required CMake Version (cmake_minimum_required)__
2. __Package Name (project())__
3. __Find other CMake/Catkin packages needed for build (find_package())__
4. Enable Python module support (catkin_python_setup())
5. Message/Service/Action Generators

    (add_message_files(), add_service_files(), add_action_files())
6. Invoke message/service/action generation (generate_messages())
7. __Specify package build info export (catkin_package())__
8. __Libraries/Executables to build (add_library()/add_executable()/target_link_libraries())__
9. Tests to build (catkin_add_gtest())
10. Install rules (install()) 

### CMake Version
Catkin requires version 2.8.3 or higher. 
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
```

### Package name
```cmake
project(package_name)
```
package name can be different from folder name.

you can reference the project name anywhere later in the CMake script by using the variable ${PROJECT_NAME} wherever needed. 


### Finding Dependent CMake Packages
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp)
```
If your project depends on other wet packages, they are automatically turned into components (in terms of CMake) of catkin.


#### What Does find_package() Do?
The environment variables describe where the packages exported header files are, where source files are, what libraries the package depends on, and the paths of those libraries. The names always follow the convention of <'PACKAGE_NAME'>_<'PROPERTY'>

```
<NAME>_INCLUDE_DIRS - The include paths exported by the package

<NAME>_LIBRARIES - The libraries exported by the package
```

#### Why Are Catkin Packages Specified as Components?
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS nodelet)
```

catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS contains the include paths not only for catkin but also for nodelet as well!

#### Boost
If using C++ and Boost, you need to invoke find_package() on Boost and specify which aspects of Boost you are using as components. For example, if you wanted to use Boost threads, you would say: 
```cmake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS thread)
```


### catkin_package()
This is required to specify catkin-specific information

This function must be called before declaring any targets with add_library() or add_executable().

The function has 5 optional arguments: 

```
INCLUDE_DIRS - The exported include paths (i.e. cflags) for the package

LIBRARIES - The exported libraries from the project

CATKIN_DEPENDS - Other catkin projects that this project depends on

DEPENDS - Non-catkin CMake projects that this project depends on.
```

example
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  nodelet
)

find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
```

```cmake
catkin_package(
   INCLUDE_DIRS include
   LIBRARIES ${PROJECT_NAME}
   CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp nodelet
   DEPENDS eigen opencv)
```

For using catkin include directories, you can write as catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS. This means the path that contains roscpp, nodelet package.

### Specifying Build Targets
It is very important to note that the names of build targets in catkin must be unique regardless of the folders they are built/installed to.

Include Paths - Where can header files be found for the code (most common in C/C++) being built


#### include_directories()
```cmake
include_directories(<dir1>, <dir2>, ..., <dirN>)
```
```cmake
include_directories(include ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```
The first argument "include" indicates that the **include/** directory within the package is also part of the path.

So, we can use #include <~> 

#### Executable Targets
To specify an executable target that must be built, we must use the add_executable() CMake function. 
```cmake
add_executable(myProgram src/main.cpp src/some_file.cpp src/another_file.cpp)
```
This will build a target executable called myProgram which is built from 3 source files: src/main.cpp, src/some_file.cpp and src/another_file.cpp. 

#### target_link_libraries
Use the target_link_libraries() function to specify which libraries an executable target links against.

This is done typically after an add_executable() call.

Syntax: 
```cmake
target_link_libraries(<executableTargetName>, <lib1>, <lib2>, ... <libN>)
```

Example:
```cmake
add_executable(foo src/foo.cpp)

target_link_libraries(foo ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```
```cmake
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} contains the path of catkin include directories.
```

### Messages, Services, and Action Targets
Messages (.msg), services (.srv), and actions (.action) files in ROS require a special preprocessor build step before being built and used by ROS packages.

There are three macros provided to handle messages, services, and actions respectively: 
```cmake
add_message_files

add_service_files

add_action_files
```

These macros must then be followed by a call to the macro that invokes generation: 
```cmake
generate_messages()
```

You must use find_package() for the package message_generation, either alone or as a component of catkin:
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS message_generation)
```

Your catkin_package() macro must have a CATKIN_DEPENDS dependency on message_runtime.
```cmake
catkin_package(
 ...
 CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
 ...)
```

These macros must come BEFORE the catkin_package() macro in order for generation to work correctly.
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS message_generation ...)
add_message_files(...)
add_service_files(...)
add_action_files(...)
generate_messages(...)

catkin_package(
...
CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
...)
...
```

Your package.xml file must contain a build dependency on message_generation and a runtime dependency on message_runtime.

you need to add an explicit dependency on target catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS, so that they are built in the correct order. 
```cmake
add_dependencies(some_target ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
```

If you have a package which builds messages and/or services as well as executables that use these, you need to create an explicit dependency on the automatically-generated message target so that they are built in the correct order. (some_target is the name of the target set by add_executable()):
```cmake
add_dependencies(some_target ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
```

#### Example
If your package has two messages in a directory called "msg" named "MyMessage1.msg" and "MyMessage2.msg" and these messages depend on std_msgs and sensor_msgs, a service in a directory called "srv" named "MyService.srv", defines executable message_program that uses these messages and service, and executable does_not_use_local_messages_program, which uses some parts of ROS, but not the messages/service defined in this package, then you will need the following in your CMakeLists.txt: 
```cmake
  # Get the information about this package's buildtime dependencies
  find_package(catkin REQUIRED
    COMPONENTS message_generation std_msgs sensor_msgs)

  # Declare the message files to be built
  add_message_files(FILES
    MyMessage1.msg
    MyMessage2.msg
  )

  # Declare the service files to be built
  add_service_files(FILES
    MyService.srv
  )

  # Actually generate the language-specific message and service files
  generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES std_msgs sensor_msgs)

  # Declare that this catkin package's runtime dependencies
  catkin_package(
   CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime std_msgs sensor_msgs
  )

  # define executable using MyMessage1 etc.
  add_executable(message_program src/main.cpp)
  add_dependencies(message_program ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

  # define executable not using any messages/services provided by this package
  add_executable(does_not_use_local_messages_program src/main.cpp)
  add_dependencies(does_not_use_local_messages_program ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
```

If, additionally, you want to build actionlib actions, and have an action specification file called "MyAction.action" in the "action" directory, you must add actionlib_msgs to the list of components which are find_packaged with catkin and add the following call before the call to generate_messages(...): 
```cmake
add_action_files(FILES
  MyAction.action
)
```


## __package.xml__
### Basic Structure
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package format="2">

</package>
```

### Required Tags
There are a minimal set of tags that need to be nested within the <package.> tag to make the package manifest complete. 

```
<name> - The name of the package

<version> - The version number of the package (required to be 3 dot-separated integers)

<description> - A description of the package contents

<maintainer> - The name of the person(s) that is/are maintaining the package

<license> - The software license(s) (e.g. GPL, BSD, ASL) under which the code is released.
```

As an example, here is package manifest for a fictional package called foo_core. 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package format="2">
  <name>foo_core</name>
  <version>1.2.4</version>
  <description>
  This package provides foo capability.
  </description>
  <maintainer email="ivana@osrf.org">Ivana Bildbotz</maintainer>
  <license>BSD</license>
</package>
```

### __Dependencies__
Packages can have six types of dependencies: 
```
Build Dependencies:
specify which packages are needed to build this package. find_package()-ed in CMake

Build Export Dependencies:
specify which packages are needed to build libraries against this package. especially when these packages are declared as (CATKIN_)DEPENDS in catkin_package() in CMake

Execution Dependencies:
specify which packages are needed to run code in this package. especially when these packages are declared as (CATKIN_)DEPENDS in catkin_package() in CMake

Build Tool Dependencies:
specify build system tools which this package needs to build itself. typically the only build tool needed is catkin.
```

These six types of dependencies are specified using the following respective tags: 
```
<depend> specifies that a dependency is a build, export, and execution dependency. This is the most commonly used dependency tag.

<build_depend> --> <depend>

<build_export_depend> --> <depend>

<exec_depend> --> <depend>

<buildtool_depend>
```

All packages have at least one dependency, a build tool dependency on catkin as the following example shows.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package format="2">
  <name>foo_core</name>
  <version>1.2.4</version>
  <description>
    This package provides foo capability.
  </description>
  <maintainer email="ivana@osrf.org">Ivana Bildbotz</maintainer>
  <license>BSD</license>

  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
</package>
```

A more realistic example that specifies build, exec, test, and doc dependencies could look as follows. 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package format="2">
  <name>foo_core</name>
  <version>1.2.4</version>
  <description>
    This package provides foo capability.
  </description>
  <maintainer email="ivana@willowgarage.com">Ivana Bildbotz</maintainer>
  <license>BSD</license>

  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>

  <depend>roscpp</depend>
  <depend>std_msgs</depend>

  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>

  <exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>rospy</exec_depend>

</package>
```

### Additional Tags
```
<url> - A URL for information on the package, typically a wiki page on ros.org.

<author> - The author(s) of the package 
```
